The application hosting platform is constructed using the following basic building blocks:

1) Protocol (protocol.py)
    The protocol interface provides basic method interfaces to construct the front-end of a protocol module.


            ------------\                     /------------
                         |       socket      |
              Interface  | <<<============>>>|  Protocol    <<<=====   Network
                         |        I/0        |
            ------------/                     \------------

    The protocol is responsible for creating the socket communication layer for the interface to use.
    The protocol is also responsible for the creation of a discovery object, if the protocol is a 
    service which others will need to connect to, or if the protocol needs notification when other
    services are available.
    The protocol interface supports either zmq sockets, or udplib broadcast sockets.
